## Overview
I build high-reliability software at the intersection of **AI systems**, **distributed computing**, and **cloud infrastructure**.  
My focus is on designing scalable backend architectures, intelligent automation pipelines, and ML-driven systems optimized for performance, resilience, and operational clarity.

I care deeply about **clean architecture, system correctness, developer experience, and long-term maintainability**.
